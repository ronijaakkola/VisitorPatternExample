# Visitor Design Pattern example
Simple Visitor Design Pattern example written in C++ for Tampere University of Technology course Software Architecture. The program calculates real prices for imported products by taking custom taxes and VAT into account. The product objects only know their initial price and the tax functionality is added on top of the classes by using a visitor class. This way adding extra functionality does not require altering the target objects at all.
